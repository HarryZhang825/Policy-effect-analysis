# Policy-effect-analysis
This depository contains the original datasets used to quantify the effects of various policies and
other socioeconomic factors upon each fishery variable. The detailed explanation for each dataset and its attributes
is given bellow:
1. C_bt -- Catch by bottom trawlers and its associated explanatory factors
2. C_dbt -- Catch by distant-water bottom trawlers and its associated explanatory factors
3. China fishery and policy data2 -- the full dataset consisted of both fishery variables and policy factors described in the manuscript
4. FIB -- fishing-in-balance index and its associated explanatory factors
5. H_dt -- horsepower of distant-water bottom trawlers beyond China's 4 seas and its associated explanatory factors
6. H_tr -- horsepower of bottom trawlers and its associated explanatory factors
7. HpV_bt -- horsepower per bottom trawler and its associated explanatory factors
8. HpV_dbt -- horsepower per distant-water bottom trawler (beyond China's 4 seas) and its associated explanatory factors
9. N_tr -- total number of bottom trawlers and its associated explanatory factors
10. policy_2D -- policy factors and their performance indices: influence-breadth index (IBI) and mean dominance index (MDI)
11. policy_2D2 -- policy categories and their performance indices: influence contribution index (ICI), policy contribution index (PCI), significant usefulness index (SUI),
                  policy usefulness index (PUI), etc.
12. RC_bt_eez -- Ratio of Catch by bottom trawlers from China's claimed EEZ to the total catch by all Chinese bottom trawlers, and its associated explanatory factors
13. RH_bt -- Ratio of horsepower of bottom trawlers to the gross horsepower of all Chinese marine catchers
14. RN_bt -- Ratio of number of bottom trawlers to the total number of Chinese marine catchers and its associated explanatory factors
15. sample -- Dataset used to construct cluster and ordination analyses.
